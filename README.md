"I have no idea what I'm doing."

This is my favorite caveat.  I don't know what I'm doing here.  I have some experience with C, C++, Swift, and some other native languages.  I'm learning Rust and I've run through the online book over the course of a couple of weekends.  This repo is, at the moment, a very humble attempt to convert those learnings into a simple project.  I don't understand Rust, but I'm learning.  I don't understand the community, but I'm exploring.  My IDE is VSCode with some extensions.  I have no idea if that's worthwhile, but I'll take another look next week.  This is where I'm at.  I'm experimenting and exploring.  I invite criticism.  I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm documenting how it's going.

## Goal

I don't have a strong goal here.  I like to "kick the tires" of new languages with a simple Poker hand simulation.  I find that it often gives me *just* enough leeway to figure out a few things without succumbing to the weight of the language or the tooling. That feels about right here.  I'm liking a lot of Rust, but there are so many items that provide legitimate criticism that I feel like there's a whole world of criticism of whether Rust can take C++'s place as a "don't pay for the abstractions" language.  I'm really just feeling that out and forming an opinion.  If you wind up taking a bit of this and developing some incredible poker software from it... well, invite me to a drink.
